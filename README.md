# UNCBootcamp-Project1


For my part of the project, I worked on the following:

•	Collaborated with my team to find a project idea that we all agreed on
•	Researched API’s to use for our project
•	I designed and coded the main page skeleton for our site in Bootstrap. We later changed the styling to Materialize CSS. 
•	I also coded the modals that we used for both the login and account setup popups.
•	I collaborated with my team to try and find solutions for any issues we were having. 
•	I contributed to the information presented on the PowerPoint for our presentation. 
•	I tried to help my team present our project in front of the class. 
I really enjoyed working with my team. I cannot say how much I valued there help and work ethic for our project. I had family emergencies occur during our project work. My team was very supportive and understood my need for having to work remotely on the project. Overall, my favorite part of the project was when our team met outside of class for “field research.” It was nice to meet with them outside of class and to get to know each other better while we worked on the project.
